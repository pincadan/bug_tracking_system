# Here's a basic implementation of a Bug Tracking System in Java:

This program defines a Bug class representing a bug with attributes such as ID, description, status, and priority. The BugTrackingSystem class manages a list of bugs and provides methods to add a bug, display bugs, and modify the status of a bug.

The main method of the program allows the user to interact with the bug tracking system. The user can choose to add a bug, display all bugs, modify the status of a specific bug, or exit the program.

Note that this is a basic implementation and may require additional features, error handling, and optimization for a production-level bug tracking system.
